# Sudoku app solver
 
Designed for my screen, but pixel coordinates can be changed.

How to :
Open the application "Sudoku" on the phone.
Connect to the computer with scrpy.
Start a sudoku then starts the script.

The different steps of the script :
1) Reads the number on the screen (PIL, OpenCV, Pytesseract)
2) Solves the sudoku with linear programming (Pyomo, Gurobi)
3)  Writes the solution on the screen (Pyautogui, Pynput)
